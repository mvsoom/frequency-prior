# Implementation

The current implementation is optimized for ease of use rather than speed. A
speedup of a factor 10 seems quite plausible. Julia instead of Python can be
used, which will speedup the nested sampling.

Two major speedups can be achieved in the likelihood functions.

- Forcing the pitch periods to have equal length, such that the `g` matrix
  calculations can be reused for each pitch period

- Applying analytical results and simplifications developed in @Bretthorst1988
  (though at first sight the trend function could make this problematic) to
  derive sufficient statistics of the data based on the DFT

- Making use of the fact that this model is a "nested one" [@vonderLinden2014, p. 472]
  to compute the evidence. See [@vonderLinden2014, Section 27.2] for more approximation
  that apply in marginalizing out background signals and a better prior for the
  amplitudes.
