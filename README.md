# Git repo for "A Weakly Informative Prior for Resonance Frequencies"

This repo contains the full code used for Experiments I and II in Section 5.

## Notebooks

Details of the Experiments:

    - `post_cmp.ipynb`: Experiment I
    - `post_free.ipynb`: Experiment II

The five waveforms used for the Experiments are visualized in
`show_data.ipynb`. The data itself is contained in `./arctic`.

Sampling of &pi;<sub>3</sub> is illustrated in `sample.ipynb`.

## Source code

`paretochain.py` contains code to sample from &pi;<sub>1</sub> (which is the
"Pareto chain prior").

## `./post` folder

Contains post-processing of the Experimental results.
